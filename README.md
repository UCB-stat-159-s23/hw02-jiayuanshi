This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the Spring 2022 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science_. All code and data is based on the original LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository.
